Give it structure
Build it strong

Is standing right in front of me
Nothing more, nothing less
Not concerned about the rest
I'm amazed and I'm ashamed

Their life's about to flash before your eyes

A way, Out of no way, MY HERO! come on and save the day!

I gotta keep it real...Lord my life needs a fix and I...

Set adrift on memory bliss of you

The camera pans the cocktail glass
Behind a blind of plastic plants
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring
Then you know I can't remember a damn thing
I think it's one of those déjà vu things
Or a dream that's tryin' to tell me somethin'
Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it
I don't know, I doubt it
Subterranean by design
I wonder what I would find
If I met you, let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Mrs Princess Who?
I often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone; solitaire
I can remember when
I caught up with a patime intimate friend
She said, bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me
She was right, though, I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind
And I just put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

A careless whisper from a careless man
A neutron dance for a neutron fan
Marionette strings are dangerous things
I thought of all the trouble they bring
An eye for an eye, a spy for spy
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning
Reality used to be a friend of mine
Cause complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on
But guess whose piece of the cake was jacked on?
She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do?
I feel for her, I really do
And I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

That's why I look up, never hide behind sky's when it rain
Promises cooked up exercisin' through denyin' the pain
That's why I look for ways find whatever lies in the rain

I don't blame my father for lampin' I believe that helped

Know I need that fall

Wasted time but now I can see
The biggest enemy is me

And why I try so hard to hide this pain
I search, but I can't ever find
Can't seem to leave my past behind
'Cause all the ones I hope would stay
Are all the ones that fade away

Truth is I think about you often
I miss your voice, I miss your smile that I used to get lost in
I know you know I have this thing for you, I never lost it
I think I just lost myself, in the midst of the nsense
9 times out of 10, I'd close my eyes and dream about you
Don't know what it was, but you just had this thing about you
Lately we've been distant, see, I just can't be without you
And my soul got so attached to yours
I can't be me without you
But, we hate ourselves because we run from the people we love
And we all hold on to the past 'cause we miss what it was
Don't wanna feel so we try to numbin' the pain with these drugs
Living in hell, 'cause we lost faith in the place up above
And my anxiety is breaking me, it kills me
I'm living in a world so fake, I lost touch of the real me
Had to take a look back, just to ask me if I'm still me
And would I still stand for this if they wanted to kill me?
I can't take it no more, I just can't take it no more
I can't smile like I'm okay, I just can't fake it no more
I can't act like I've been happy and complacent no more
'Cause every time I try to change, it is the same as before
My karma's coming, my karma's coming, it's weighing in
I'm drinking till all my feelings just fade away again
And mama, she always told me ""this ain't a way to live""
But, when you feel what I'm feeling that's just the way it is
I'm trying not to break down but I just can't hide this pain
Saw myself in the mirror and I'm just not the same
But who's to blame? I guess we all change
We hurt the ones we love because of our pain, fuck...

I’m your host like every night LB
And uhhh we got two of the biggest stars in the world right now
I mean, we can’t go anywhere without hearing their names
Now you two usually keep it private but you’re about to open up and uhhh I guess we’ll start with you
And tell us how you’re feeling

See I’m a real woman
A women that doesn’t need much but
Appreciates a whole lot
And he always call me crazy, but i’m not crazy
I’m from LA where the sun’s always shining so a lot of people are shady
But at least I got my baby
Yeah, right baby
Right, look
What’s the difference between real love and fake love
The same difference between real titties and fake ones
You can feel the difference
And even though it changes overtime
It stays consistent, I ain't gonna lie though, it takes persistence
But you the one I wanna be with when the ball drop
That’s why I send for you like the call drop
Plus I know all your insecurities
And I don’t mean like mall cops
I mean the type we all got
I’m never focused on my exes more than our execution
No time to be stressed and confusing
A happy home is the best to move in
Just like happy endings can be the best conclusion
My dad used to say real love can be the best illusion
Because when you think it’s there, it’s already moving
And some feelings will leave before the rest can move in
And I know both of our families are divorced and suing
But look, this ain't repetition, it’s evolution
You changed the theory up
You the type to have the hardest nigga tearing up
And all your friends around you try to get their appearance up
When you ain't even wearing much
But real enough to remind me to hit my parents up
Wow. I mean… make some noise for em'
Everybody, make some noise
I mean that’s, that’s real love you know?
That’s beautiful. Makes me want to call my wife up and tell her I love her. You seem like a staup guy, like you really have her best interest… oh

Yeah, he’s sweet
I mean you, know, when he wants to be, not all the time
Let’s not front in front of all these people, nigga
Don’t act like just a couple weeks ago, you wasn’t fucking with them bitches
Out here, disrespecting me
I mean you know I fucked up too
Went through your phone you wasn’t looking
And I found out, but if we in the same house, the same building
Then you can’t interrupt a happy home that’s still buildin'
You ol’ sneaky ass nigga

Fuck is you sayin'?
Who are you talkin' to?
Never called you a bitch, but who are you barkin' to?
Look, you disrespecting me, calling me a lying ass nigga
Who are you trying, am I on trial?
Are you not the number one on my speed dial
You know that you tripping
You need guidance
You got these people inside our business
Like U and I is
You probably didn’t even catch that did you
You’re too undivided
You’re too undecisive
You’re too one sided
You the type to kick me out the house after I buy it
And then talk to me like you’re the pro when I’m the one that’s been providing
I hate talking about what’s private when we not in private
‘Cause I don’t want to say nothing to piss your mother off
Since we inviting everyone in the bedroom
Let’s take the covers off
And talking about how you fucking what’s his name who’s so fucking lame
I wish I would’ve known before I took the rubber off (ah!)
Got me questioning like is this even love at all
I used to see my future in your eyes like the crystal ball
Looking for some feelings in the lost and found
Contemplating
Thinking how we supposed to hold each other down if we can’t even hold on a conversation
You take the sex away then what else are we left to lay in
I’m tired of fronting for these people who ain't got our back
‘Cause to them it’s all entertainment
And they not looking at us like we real people
Or like we up here just fuckin playing
And time’s the only thing we can’t afford
Then why would waste it
How we supposed to face our problems
If we can’t even face to face it
The fuck

Way too much

When I speak it's like ya'll don't hear
Why I feel like God don't care
Why I feel like I ain't good as no one else
I'm searching but my pride ain't there
I just feel like life ain't fair
My boy got shot, died right there
But me, I died twice and came back to life
So tell me how can I be scared
Why do I gotta doubt myself
All I ever do is doubt myself
Drink liquor till the head gets consumed by the pint, like
I don't care about my health
Really I'm just trying to numb the pain
Love and hate it all just feels the same
Won't say I'm affected by the fame
But even my momma know I changed
So I get drunk till I can't feel
The love fake, the pains real
Got so many scars it ain't heal
But I gotta soul bullets can't kill
Why I feel like cops just want to pop me
Pop's never had a pot to piss in
Probably pack a nine on his hip then sit beside me
Pray to God there's no triple six inside me
No I can't let the devil in my mind
Same time the church will turn you blind
Last time I heard a preacher preach a sermon
All I heard him say was sinner's going to die
And they will never get to see a Heaven
With all due respect fuck the reverend
'Cause I know life is doing 25
Praying for early death like it's a blessing
This for my people going through depression
This for the kids who never felt affection
This for the kids whose parents don't accept them
Saying they love everyone else except them
I know what it's like to feel alone
I know what it's like to need a home
I know what it's like to not know what it's like
To have a love you can call your own
See I done tried every single fucking drug on that shelf
Trust me man it don't help
I just feel like I'm losing myself
I just feel like I'm losing myself
I just feel like I'm losing myself
I just feel like I'm losing myself
I just feel like I'm losing myself

Why I feel like love don't last
Things change when you move so fast
I was trying to focus on us in the future
You was focused on my past
If you left I would lose my soul
Promise me that you won't let go
See I just need love, it's funny I've got all this money
But my heart still broke
So many times I said I'ma change
Just to turn around and do the same
Same shit that's been putting you in pain
I know I'm the only one to blame
So I get drunk, till I can't see
I love you, but I hate me
For tryna be someone I can't be
And I ain't been myself lately
Why I feel like I'm the only one that got me
You could take the same 45 that shot me
Pop the clip in, cock it back and put that motherfucker to my head, you'll never stop me
Yeah I be living life on the edge
Suicide all in my head
Why the world don't care about no one else's life till they already dead
I just wish my pops was back to how he was
'Cause he ain't been the same since the drugs
And I ain't been the same since he said
The worst form of pain is not being loved
So we use the drugs that they gave to us
To replace the love the world takes from us
Lately I don't even know who to trust
They saying even Satan was an angel once
So I can't feel shit, so numb that I can't feel shit
Living just to die, we dying just to live
This life it doesn't make no sense
See I done tried every single fucking drug on that shelf
Trust me man it don't help
I just feel like I'm losing myself
I just feel like I'm losing myself

And you are everything I wanted
You knew I'd fuck you over someday, so you ran away
Cut me off cause you already knew wassup

And I did not show you that I care but now I miss you

Why am I gonna apologize?
What have I even done?
Why you acting like you lost the crown
If you were never wearing one?
Falling ever deeper, dealing cards now
Now you can't recognize yourself on the deck
I thought I was your queen of hearts
But all the aces stole the check
A prince, a prince
A glorious game
A prince, a prince
Checkmate 'til you stole me away

Cursing words, am I a pauper now?
Even though all my shoes do fit
Won't even let me leave the house past 12
I ain't no fairytale chick
Happy endings cloud your head now
You have put your expectations too high
Sit on the bed, tears running down our eyes
Once upon a time, I wonder why

A prince, a prince
A glorious game
A prince, a prince
Checkmate 'til you stole me away

Darling hold on a second
You know that your eyes and your smile are a weapon
Now come here, why won't you just listen?
You tell me I'm hurting your arm with my grip
See now trust me, but never trust women
Yeah they're perfect, I'm at home stressed
With this skunk spliff
When I know that you're out on the road being faithless
Does it make sense?
And my insecurities don't pay rent
But they're living with me
And this is a disease
We live in a man's world so what you expect me to be?
Now, now, now
Whether it's the shit sex or this limp dick
My reflection keeps telling me sick things
You know that I'm ugly
I hope that you want me, I'll make sure you love me

A glorious game
A prince, a prince
Checkmate 'til you stole me away

No I've never been a prince, no, no
And I tried to be a king, oh Lord
Said I've never been a prince, no, no
And I tried to be a king, but I let you down, my queen

He will do what it takes to survive.”

You built cathedrals

In every line, for some kind of sign

He has flown too close to the sun.”

She steps out for a cigarette
And, I've been prayin' all night
Like G she gives life to my world with a ""Can I get a light?""
Ignite a match
She leans in to catch it
We're, the only spark in the dark like a chandelier
With no ceiling but the sky
As the smoke from her lips bleeds into the atmosphere
No ashes here, no dust
This moment is forever
Even though each puff will take us further from together
She'll have, me until the very last drag
Come to think of it, love is like a cigarette
Burning at the tip of it, but quick to burn out
Like a cigarette, it may get you sick
But you'll never get sick of it

And I don't trust no one at all
Far away from you
I've already paid my dues
I don't got a lot but I'm making do
I'm trying just to get along

Went to muddy water from holy water
From being children, to slaying daughters

Who gon' go to hell for me?
Tryna give myself a reason to keep believing in season that leaves fall for me
Say, boy don't talk to me
Get from 'round my way
Can't judge 'round my way

You gon' be so rich and don't ever show it
You can buy all the clothes you need and still don't visit me
I called your brother on his cell phone
He said you went out and you ain't been home
You're always partying late
Hope that you safe
You don't even message me when you leave out the States
You know it's real out here for us
Its like you don't care enough
But out here baby boy's so far gone
Lord knows I ain't been home in so long
Game so deep and the drinks so strong
And I don't trust no one at all
Far away from you
I've already paid my dues
I don't got a lot but I'm making do
I'm trying just to get along

Went from being cozy to living crazy
From ""you don't know me"" to wanting babies

Say, boy don't talk to me
Get from 'round my way

I'll never get him back

I could see the tears fall from her eyes
Her child was always in something
Why won't you hold me (I just wanna be held)
Sweet, dark, & holy
I'm safe in your arms
There was a time where all I needed was a pencil
Just to keep the stresses of this cold world out my mental

They don't know what I been through
Do the same things my friends do
So who am I?
I ain't got the time for no rainy days
'Cause who gon' listen when I talk about my day to day
Not that I'm hiding
It's just safer being silent these days

I turn your dry spot to an oasis
I kiss the right spots, I know all the places
Oh I lick the right spots, that's an ultimatum
The loud in rotation, cloud 9, flotation
Let the rose petals spread like rosacea
I know your ex to blame for your cold nature
Tell him stay in his lane, stop the road ragin'
And now I got you in here makin' those faces
Runnin' 'round the bedroom like four bases, moolah!

But this is new to me, this is new to you

Could fill up an album with everything that they're missin'
They so superficial, don't understand how we're chillin'
We don't need a lot, we got us and that's why we're winnin'
To them it's a park bench, us a magic carpet

In a villa in Negril drinking wine as if we Jamaican
So call me Liam Neeson, tell them niggas you taken
You just so advanced, them other bitches is basic
You bad on your own, but we so much better together
Just give me the green light, I'm ready when you ready
Told me just to wait a little longer (but how much longer, baby?)

Is the thought of us together

Love and death are quite similar
How they come and go like cat burglars
Reality is kinda hard to face
Like actual facts is for flearthers
Rain's a requirement for flowers to grow
And pain's a requirement for power to grow
It's a miracle how one can change
From one what was just hours ago
Such is life though, it's just a cycle
The bigger picture and the smaller picture
Are exactly the same, it's macro, micro
Crack your atom and let your light glow
One day, you could be the king of pop
And the next one just be ""Wacko"" Michael
It's human nature, just like he told us
Let's face reality, crack the cycle
Know it hurts to see the truth in your face
Circumstances bring you down to your knees
Go on and cry an ocean, but don't drown in it
Enough to put your heart at ease
Oh, don't lose your seesteem
I apologize, for being a man
It's way harder than what it seems

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh (reality)
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh (you might get mad at me, but I'll be at your bedside)
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Sometimes it's hard to face reality",385,3.2761666666666667,117.5153889199776

Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
You better not run 'cause the sirens not coming for you
What have you done?
You went to school that day
Was a bit late but it was a Monday
Kept after class for answering back
You apologized, ain't no harm in that?
(I wanna turn those blue lights)
What have you done?
(Into strobe lights)
There's no need to run
(Not blue flashing lights)
If you've done nothing wrong
(Maybe fairy lights)
Blue lights should just pass you by
Gun crime into your right ear
Drugs and violence into your left
Default white headphones flooding the auditory
Subconscious waves you accept
You're sitting on the 4 back home
""Where you at, G? Answer your phone!""
Paused the poison to answer his message
Your boy sounds rushed, fears for his adolescence

(I wanna turn those blue lights)
What have you done?
(Into strobe lights)
There's no need to run
(Not blue flashing lights)
If you've done nothing wrong
(Maybe fairy lights)
Blue lights should just pass you by
Tall black shadow as you're getting off the bus
Shadow shows no emotion so what's even the fuss?
But the face on your boy casts a darker picture
Of the red handed act, he's gonna whisper;
""Look blud, I'm sorry, 'cause I know you got my back
He was running, I couldn't think, I had to get out of that""
Not long ago you were miming to the ""Shook Ones""
Now this really is part two 'cause you're the shook one
Hands you the tool as you question your friendship
How's man like you gonna make me a convict?
Level of a felon when I've done nothing wrong
Blood on my hands but I don't know where it's from, oh
You got blood on your hands but you don't know where it's from

You better run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
'Cause they will be coming for you
Run when you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
The blue lights are coming for you

Underneath that waterfall, nobody else ever saw
I packed up everything except those memories
That only I can see, and can't get rid of
I still remember the first, your body hit every nerve
Used to wake up in my shirt, that's the one I had to burn
Trying not to stare, but you are everywhere
You're everywhere that I've ever known

You feel like Brooklyn in the summer
Been hiding, half awake for so long
And it's the subtleties only you've ever seen
Bringing the mess of me back together
You feel like Brooklyn in the summer
Been stumbling, half awake for so long
Gotta forget that feeling, give into something real
I've got, I've gotta let you go
Gotta let you go
This morning I walked to the train, just like you did every day
Everyone else is the same, I wonder if you're the same
And do you lay your head in someone else's bed
To help you bury it? Just like you always did
And now you're in all of my words, only way I can return
Memories fade in reverse, but you will always be heard
Wherever I can sing, you'll be right there with me
In ghosts and melodies that only I can see

But maybe I'm not really ready to give up you
'Cause nobody ever mattered to me like you do
'Cause you're so appealing, I caught that feeling
And touch the ceiling, ooh
I wish I could describe it but words just ain't enough
And nothing that I could say would ever measure up
But what I can't stand is you're outta my hands
And I'm outta your plans, ooh

I feel so stupid 'cause I bragged to the homies like she the one
A burder flower, I feel so sad, all these roses fill up my gun
Sincerely Tyguan Terell, I wrote her letters from the joint
Give you the keys for that brand new tesla
Off of the one, unlock your thought 
They hate on me and jai forever
I let you in and showed you how I fell and you still didn't keep it a hunnid
I opened up, showed you my hurt, now I wish I didn't even bother
I was tryna find a way to get my team across

While I drive, are you gettin' on the train?

You would know if you stayed
You would know if you put up a fight
Your toes turn blue in winter, I'm gettin' red, rum
Does the trick for all of the things left unsaid, I'm
Missin' our drunken 2 A.M. strolls in Town
Now you're chasing fake highs in the Upper West Side
And fuckin' on Brooklyns in Brooklyn
Your Chelseas in Chelsea
Hope that eases the pain, so you remember to miss me
And you sold your car, now you walk for miles
Bet your feet feel numb
Crosswalks in my mind are shaky, so please hold on tight

All my demons run wild
All my demons have your smile
In the city of angels, in the city of angels
Hope New York holds you
Hope it holds you like I do
While my demons stay faithful
In the city of angels

Summer's endin' now and the nights are coolin' down
Remember last winter when we would drive around?
Silverlake, Hollywood, pretty little white lies got me good
Thought this was love, I was misunderstood, mmm

Feelin' low on the low, drivin' through NoHo
If I'm honest, I'd call, but I'm trying to let go
And I hope you're happy, livin' life in taxis
But you'll always have me, you'll always have me

Edited my pictures with the Microsoft filters

Custmade drip with the pastry couture
Selling Silly Bandz from my desk to my drawer
Singing karaoke while my mom was at the store (""You are"")
Scared that she would walk in on me singing Paramore (""The only exception"")
While y'all was sticking house keys in motherfucking sockets (""You are"")
I was stuffing all y’all lunch moneys in my pocket

If it's hard to love me lil' baby I apologize
All these love scars on my heart got me traumatized
Keep it to myself so my pain isn't televised
Niggas ain't yo' brothers it was hard for me to recognize
When I feel alone I don't ask no one for help
Arguments inside my head, been losing battles to myself
I was taught remain humble, play the cards that I was dealt
And if you don't love who you are then you can't love nobody else
If he get caught up in the storm, pussy nigga he'll got rained on
Tryna find a way to make out, I had to brainstorm
I'ma keep on fighting all these demons 'til this pain gone
Ever since you left my heart keep singing all these pain songs
Weight on my chest, I can't breathe
I've been trapped in your lies, I can't leave
I can show you real, just follow my lead
Please hold me down, that's all that I need

Baby I fell in love with your energy
I can never give you all of me, just what's left of me
I can always tell when they gon' leave I peep them tendencies
Who you know can heal a broken heart, I need the remedy
These tears weighin' heavily
Just another sad song that's been playing in my head
You can never take back all that mini shit you said
Ain't tryna be in the streets, found a better way instead
How she tryna hit my phone, she used to leave my ass on read

Niggas tryna live it up with me but left me out for dead
I'ma drop another bag for every tear I had to shed
Never buy into the hate, don't let it get inside yo' head
And if the love is genuine then I should never have to beg
I told you that I needed you, you let me down repeatedly
I'ma make sure you regret the way you treated me
Peeped your true colors, you ain't never have respect for me
So fuck you and your feelings and I say that shit respectfully
If it's hard to love me lil' baby I apologize

But I still care for you, thick and thin
You can't say I wasn't there for you, cause I was
Couldn't see the lies I was blinded by the love
Had to move on and let go of who I was

Cause it hurts when I hear yo name
This is why I'm steady writing heartbreak songs
Cause I'm so poetic with my pain

Holdin' back tears but It's hard for me to manage it
Tired of being hurt I'm a product of my abandonment
How you do me wrong and try to say it was an accident
You did what you did at the expense of my happiness
Should've deemed my heart need a break
Feelings hard for me to shake
You don't know much it takes to keep a smile on my face
You used to beg for me to stay but now you dying for space
You just love you when you want like I'm easy to replace
Ooh I can't stand it
All thanks to you my soul's damaged
Pain turned me into a savage
Heart ain't been right since you had it
And the girl of my dreams been the reason that I stay up
Why you only recognize my worth after we break up
We in France alone I was the one you would rely on
Giving you cold shoulders same one you used to cry on
Said you'd never leave then you left like it was effortless
Even from the start I never thought that we were meant for this
I was scared of love cause I know it could be treacherous
Giving you my heart you left it open like my messages
Hurting in pain gotta let it go
Hurting inside but don't let it show
I ain't never felt this way before
So I'm singing this song just to let you know

Heard you got a new nigga
Laying in my bed but it feel a little bigger
I was so young when I fell in love with her
Trying to forget but I tend to reminisce when scrolling through old pictures (Woah)
Been living with pain day to day
Thinking 'bout the shit I should've said that I ain't get to say
Tryna move on for so long but I can't find a way
Wish memories would pull up like Kobe and just fade away
Mentally, don't know what you did to me
Nothing I could do that would erase all of this history
All this heart damage turned me into a savage
How our happiest memories also make me the saddest?
You thе only one I would run to
Needed an escapе you was the one who'd always come through
Though you not mine I always wonder what you up to
I can't explain why but I guess that's just what love do
And I really miss your energy
Don't know what you meant to me
Fuck Snapchat, always bringing up our memories
You the only one I can say really accepted me
Though I still remember every secret that you said to me
Wish that you was all mine
Honestly I'm not fine
Guess we fucked up and found love at the wrong time
But I'm still chasing after you
Tryna find a way back to you

If I knew that'd be the last time I'd ever get to hold you then I would've held you longer
Tend to blame myself know I should've held on
Wish I was a little bit stronger for you
Know it hurts there ain't no need to pretend
I can try to make it right
But I can't make you love me again

Everyday gets harder
You pushing me farther
Killing me inside but I'm acting like I'm unbothered
Turning me cold hearted
Since the day that we parted
Wishing that I could take it all back to where we had started
Back then, we was only friends
Started off so beautiful but look at where we end
Only opened up to you I wouldn't let nobody in
I don't think no one can ever make my heart do that again
But I still wish the best for you
Never gonna change that
Hoping there's a spark inside that's bound to bring our flame back
Smile on my face but my eyes holding rain back
I'll just take our memories and bury 'em where my pain at
Never been in love 'til now this is new to me
Do I miss us or am I missing who we used to be?
Really got me tripping can't explain what you do to me
When I said ""I love you"" understand I said that truthfully
So hold on tight for the ride it get bumpy
I know that it's selfish but I'm hoping you still love me
I just never thought we would be in this position
In fact it became so different influenced by bad decisions
I wish that you was all mine
Honestly I'm not fine
Guess we fucked up and found love at the wrong time
But I'm still chasing after you
Tryna find a way back to you

If I knew that'd be the last time I'd ever get to hold you then I would've held you longer
Tend to blame myself know I should've held on

Think I could use a little perspective from you
I do

Would you, would you?

Would you, would you?
I’m way too young to feel this numb, yea
Would you, would you?

I don’t know Khamari, you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself
But I, I don’t think it’s too much that you can’t handle
It’s just a matter of focusing on what you gotta do
And sometimes you know, you just have to, just relax and go with the flow
Things always have a way of working out, man
Just focus on what you’ve got to do, and you know what I always say
To get something you never had, you have to do something you never did
You have to take time to live

Playing ""Here Comes The Bridе"" as a warning
The reality set in
Wе don't wanna do this anymore
Can't go through with this no more
Cold feet, someone, speak up
Or forever, hold your peace
Stand up, say it loud
Hear the whispers in the crowd
Somebody stop us now
Before we say our vows
Rice thrown in the air
Family cheer and praise (Praise)
Droptop drives away
""Just married"" on our plates
Before we get too far
And this ends the hard way (Way)
Just keep your white gown in the closet
And this black tuxedo that I never get to wear
No flower girl to walk with the ring bearer
No grooms and no raising glass in air

Well, now I know, we'll never know what happens
When our love just ain't the same no more
There's only divorce, we're waiting for our time
When emotions run their course

White gown in the closet (Closet)
And these rings that we'll never get to wear
Bridesmaids won't catch bouquets in the air
Train of garment won't be dragging down the stairs

Our love story's ended way too soon
You're supposed to love me to the tomb
Hardly stood a chance to tell the truth
Speak, baby, tell me that you knew
We came all this way to lose

But, what I did learn, is
Love will give you what you need
But also, take what you don't appreciate
This is crazy
This is crazy
Anyway, umm
Alright, I'ma get off the phone 'cause
I got some crying to do
It's happy tears, though
Love you",341,3.341266666666667,102.05710409226042

Take my heart and put it on the train tracks
Or take a silver bullet and just aim it where my brain at
Bleed for ya, breath for ya, here for ya, need for ya
Don't know how you did it, never saw myself leavin' ya
Thought you wouldn't change, but it's okay, I still believe in ya

Told you, one day I'ma rock you like my sweater

You messed it up
I know you don't care, but now, you out of love

Under the still and clear indigo
You said ""Baby, don't cry, we'll be fine
You're the one thing I swear I can't outgrow""

And instead deters your airplane's way

Learned real world superpowers lived in three words
They revitalized my frayin' bones, oh

Pillar crumbled down, you've lost all solid ground
Both dreams and demons drowned and this void's all you've found
And doubts light it aglow?
I have so many questions
But I'm pourin' them into the ocean and I'm startin' up my engine
And I'm lettin' go
I'm givin' up your ghost
It's come to a close
