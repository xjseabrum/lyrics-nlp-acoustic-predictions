Cryin', ""I don't want you to go""
You wiped away tears, but not fears
Under the still and clear indigo
You said ""Baby, don't cry, we'll be fine
You're the one thing I swear I can't outgrow""

My mother said the younger me was a pretending prodigy
Well, nothin', then, much has changed
'Cause while you're wolfin' down liquor
My soul, it gets sicker
But I'm stickin' to the screenplay
Gotta say I'm okay, but answer this, babe
How is it now that, somehow, you're a strangеr?
You were mine just yеsterday
I pray the block in my airway dissipates
And instead deters your airplane's way
But heaven denied
Destiny decried
Somethin' beautiful died
Too soon

But I'm lettin' go
I'm givin' up the ghost
But don't get me wrong

Like blush wine and sonorous soirées
But even with gin and surgin' adrenaline

Learned real world superpowers lived in three words
They revitalized my frayin' bones, oh

Pillar crumbled down, you've lost all solid ground
Both dreams and demons drowned and this void's all you've found
And doubts light it aglow?
I have so many questions
But I'm pourin' them into the ocean and I'm startin' up my engine
And I'm lettin' go

Keep it to myself so my pain isn't televised
Niggas ain't yo' brothers it was hard for me to recognize
When I feel alone I don't ask no one for help
Arguments inside my head, been losing battles to myself
I was taught remain humble, play the cards that I was dealt
And if you don't love who you are then you can't love nobody else
If he get caught up in the storm, pussy nigga he'll got rained on
Tryna find a way to make out, I had to brainstorm
I'ma keep on fighting all these demons 'til this pain gone
Ever since you left my heart keep singing all these pain songs
Weight on my chest, I can't breathe
I've been trapped in your lies, I can't leave
I can show you real, just follow my lead
Please hold me down, that's all that I need

Baby I fell in love with your energy
I can never give you all of me, just what's left of me
I can always tell when they gon' leave I peep them tendencies
Who you know can heal a broken heart, I need the remedy
These tears weighin' heavily
Just another sad song that's been playing in my head
You can never take back all that mini shit you said
Ain't tryna be in the streets, found a better way instead
How she tryna hit my phone, she used to leave my ass on read

Niggas tryna live it up with me but left me out for dead
I'ma drop another bag for every tear I had to shed
Never buy into the hate, don't let it get inside yo' head
And if the love is genuine then I should never have to beg
I told you that I needed you, you let me down repeatedly
I'ma make sure you regret the way you treated me
Peeped your true colors, you ain't never have respect for me
So fuck you and your feelings and I say that shit respectfully

Answer this question and I'll answer what you asking me
What happened if we got in an accident died tragically
And next lifetime you remembered and had to come after me
And convinced me that we not meant to be that have to be
And like the defending champs you had to win it all back for me
Just got to know how deep is our love actually
What if this was the end and we had to bow out together

Next year, every year, you've been here for every tear
You complete me even though I'm whole on my own
I had you on ice like the snow when it's gone
Look, you should slide my way, be easy on the brakes
Black ice, never catch me slippin' bae
I buy the extraordinary stay, in the A or in LA
Put that Snoh and Stevie Wonder on replay, replay
And we can get away, ridin' down PCH
Like it's back in the day and now the record on replay
I'm by your side like Sade, two lovers in the Bentley coupe, coupe
And I try not to show but eyes can't hide how I'm feelin' on the low
I just wanna two step until we can't no mo'
Gettin' older sittin' next to you, you (You, ooh, woo)

Risky business, judgment warped
Solace in your innermost

Roll up 'fore I answer why

Flying forty stories down below

Miss the highs and the lows

Only check the weather when your hair did, damn it

Running out of time so you should know
Copped this one way out to Mexico
Cause you compress my soul and call it love

We are all supposed to meet by the bridge
I'm not not the only one who's late
I'm wearing the black tight again tonight
Snap!
My phone already rang twice and I forgot to bring the wine
Tell me
Do you ride, to where the muses hide, do you like the sight
(Chorus)
As we ride to the town of meet serenading to the streets
I never wanna go to sleep, apologize to my sore feet
When I grow old I'll still be me (When I grow old I'll still be me )
(And then we'll do this every week)
I guess I'm still looking, looking for trouble
I guess I'm still looking, looking for trouble
I notice red lipstick on my teeth in the restroom while we all pee
As I forget my name and my street
The room is empty doing the scan
Tomorrow’s day won’t stand chance
The night time is the right time to take a ride
To where the muses hide
Do you like the sight

Like a truce to be made
There's two sides to the pain
Pray I choose right anyway
Wired to chasе love
Wipe my tears in thе face of death
No need for a chaser
Hoping the moment don't fade 'til I'm high again
Focus on mine, keep faith, and we'll fly again
Love, at least I can when you're right here
I know the feeling might change when the night ends
Unless the world stops for you, but
Oh, there she goes, Mrs. Summer
Breaking hearts again
While I wait for her number
She plagues my mind again
I hope we never end
Take my time living in pretend
'Til I play my role, she'll be running
On and on again
Oooh, oooh
On and on again
Oooh, oooh
On and on again"

Cause right now is when I need you the most
Things ain't always what they seem until you see em' up close
So can you see it?
If I said you were the one, would you believe it?
If I told you love is pain, would that be something you'd agree with?
Just leave it and see where life takes us
I know you've heard a lot of shit
But I promised it, no one's gonna break us
Lying on the ground, looking at the stars above
Wondering if the angels are looking down on us
It got me wondering if Lalo can see me
Cause if he could, he'd probably be proud of me, life isn't easy
I know it, especially when your loved one's coming and going
I'm having trouble with my feelings, can't show no emotions
Gave em' everything I had, you can call it devotion
Did this for my people and my family, I hope that they notice
Yeah, but as time keeps passing
Everything changes, that's the way things happen
I used to hate that I loved you so much
Cause when I felt like giving up
In my mind you were stuck
Stuck in my mind, shit I just couldn't leave you behind
Till I realized that all I really needed was time
Cause time heals everything, even broken hearts
Run my fingers through your hair, till you kiss me in the dark
Form my hands around your waist, tell you everything's okay
Listen, all I need is you girl, so tell me that you'll stay
In touch with the soul, intact with the spirit
I wrote this song for you, I just hope that you hear it
But if not, at least I know I tried
Throw my ashes in the ocean, feel my spirit in the sky
Sometimes I sit alone, all alone and wonder why
Why life is such a motherfucking bitch and then you die
Well, shit I guess nothing's guaranteed in life
I just hope you think of me before you sleep at night
I'm depressed, the doctor just says I ain't eating right
But I feel like it's something more than that
Cause it hurts to know that Brian has cancer
Cause that's what my grandpa died from
So many questions with no answers
Guess these are the things you just can't hide from
But I don't wanna hide no more
I don't wanna be shy when I look into your eyes no more
I don't want nobody else cause baby I'm all yours
And I'mma let it be known from CA to the 904
Everyone needs someone, no one wants to be forgotten
Cause we all need someone to talk with
Someone that we can share our thoughts with
2 AM cartoons, rice krispies and hot chocolate
What I'm tryna say is that somebody for me is you
It was our destiny to meet, I know you see it too
But as time keeps ticking away
I love you like you'll never know until the end of my days
Yours Truly
I feel your heart becoming close
I love you like you'll never know
I feel your heart becoming so close
I love you like you'll never know
As time is passing by
I sit alone and wonder why
I sit alone and wonder why"
