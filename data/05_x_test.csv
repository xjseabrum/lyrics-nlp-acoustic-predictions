You're on my mind, I'm in your heart, I love the vibe
We don't do titles but if we did they'd be unified
Is it love, lust? Uh, we let the mood decide
I maneuver through them thighs, I'm makin' sure you oblige
Like, what's the 411? I am so punch drunk
I am in hot water like good night, Rev Run
Heaven's missin' an angel, 'cause heaven know I seen one
'Fore I check on another I should be checkin' my pulse
Drop top lookin' drtop gorgeous
Balenciaga mama, you will not pay for it
Flight change, I upgrade ya serious
I get you nice things but don't change for material possessions
I know you love flexin'
I know I love my privacy, we can't meet in the middle
But I can be the remedy 'cause baby, you the illest
I communicate the best 'cause we can't illustrate the feelin', inexplicable
And with that said, the less that's said, the better
Smoke a couple petals and I'll tell you 'bout the pedestal I got you on forever
'Cause I got you on forever
If love is like a concert, lil' mama, this a residency
I ain't gon' let up, I ain't gon' let up
I think so highly of you, buy you infinite stilettos
And intimacy's necessary but she love aggression
So I bring my doll to life, it's more like I'm Geppetto
But better, Folarin
Take your time (With the way you love me, babe)
Not a day goes by (I'm not thinkin' of you, babe)
Oh, you changed my life (You changed everything now)
It's better, it's better when you're here
Here (Woo)

I’m your host like every night LB
And uhhh we got two of the biggest stars in the world right now
I mean, we can’t go anywhere without hearing their names
Now you two usually keep it private but you’re about to open up and uhhh I guess we’ll start with you
And tell us how you’re feeling

See I’m a real woman
A women that doesn’t need much but
Appreciates a whole lot
And he always call me crazy, but i’m not crazy
I’m from LA where the sun’s always shining so a lot of people are shady
But at least I got my baby
Yeah, right baby
Right, look
What’s the difference between real love and fake love
The same difference between real titties and fake ones
You can feel the difference
And even though it changes overtime
It stays consistent, I ain't gonna lie though, it takes persistence
But you the one I wanna be with when the ball drop
That’s why I send for you like the call drop
Plus I know all your insecurities
And I don’t mean like mall cops
I mean the type we all got
I’m never focused on my exes more than our execution
No time to be stressed and confusing
A happy home is the best to move in
Just like happy endings can be the best conclusion
My dad used to say real love can be the best illusion
Because when you think it’s there, it’s already moving
And some feelings will leave before the rest can move in
And I know both of our families are divorced and suing
But look, this ain't repetition, it’s evolution
You changed the theory up
You the type to have the hardest nigga tearing up
And all your friends around you try to get their appearance up
When you ain't even wearing much
But real enough to remind me to hit my parents up
Wow. I mean… make some noise for em'
Everybody, make some noise
I mean that’s, that’s real love you know?
That’s beautiful. Makes me want to call my wife up and tell her I love her. You seem like a staup guy, like you really have her best interest… oh

Yeah, he’s sweet
I mean you, know, when he wants to be, not all the time
Let’s not front in front of all these people, nigga
Don’t act like just a couple weeks ago, you wasn’t fucking with them bitches
Out here, disrespecting me
I mean you know I fucked up too
Went through your phone you wasn’t looking
And I found out, but if we in the same house, the same building
Then you can’t interrupt a happy home that’s still buildin'
You ol’ sneaky ass nigga

Fuck is you sayin'?
Who are you talkin' to?
Never called you a bitch, but who are you barkin' to?
Look, you disrespecting me, calling me a lying ass nigga
Who are you trying, am I on trial?
Are you not the number one on my speed dial
You know that you tripping
You need guidance
You got these people inside our business
Like U and I is
You probably didn’t even catch that did you
You’re too undivided
You’re too undecisive
You’re too one sided
You the type to kick me out the house after I buy it
And then talk to me like you’re the pro when I’m the one that’s been providing
I hate talking about what’s private when we not in private
‘Cause I don’t want to say nothing to piss your mother off
Since we inviting everyone in the bedroom
Let’s take the covers off
And talking about how you fucking what’s his name who’s so fucking lame
I wish I would’ve known before I took the rubber off (ah!)
Got me questioning like is this even love at all
I used to see my future in your eyes like the crystal ball
Looking for some feelings in the lost and found
Contemplating
Thinking how we supposed to hold each other down if we can’t even hold on a conversation
You take the sex away then what else are we left to lay in
I’m tired of fronting for these people who ain't got our back
‘Cause to them it’s all entertainment
And they not looking at us like we real people
Or like we up here just fuckin playing
And time’s the only thing we can’t afford
Then why would waste it
How we supposed to face our problems
If we can’t even face to face it
The fuck
Fuck this shit"

Please don't tell me you like my dress
Why am I wishin' we were wearing less?
Won't be long before ""no"" becomes ""yes""

And you know, you know, you know
All the ways to get to me
As if there were an easy recipe
A bit of haget, a dash of sweet

Tribute to our history
Only reenactin', no repeats

You would know if you put up a fight
Your toes turn blue in winter, I'm gettin' red, rum
Does the trick for all of the things left unsaid, I'm
Missin' our drunken 2 A.M. strolls in Town
Now you're chasing fake highs in the Upper West Side
And fuckin' on Brooklyns in Brooklyn
Your Chelseas in Chelsea
Hope that eases the pain, so you remember to miss me
And you sold your car, now you walk for miles
Bet your feet feel numb
Crosswalks in my mind are shaky, so please hold on tight

All my demons run wild
All my demons have your smile
In the city of angels, in the city of angels
Hope New York holds you
Hope it holds you like I do
While my demons stay faithful
In the city of angels

Summer's endin' now and the nights are coolin' down
Remember last winter when we would drive around?
Silverlake, Hollywood, pretty little white lies got me good
Thought this was love, I was misunderstood, mmm

Feelin' low on the low, drivin' through NoHo
If I'm honest, I'd call, but I'm trying to let go
And I hope you're happy, livin' life in taxis
But you'll always have me, you'll always have me
All my demons run wild
All my demons have your smile

Hope New York holds you

The times we had
I remember everything especially the best

Got a lot of drugs with me right now
But I'd rather just get high off you
'Cause it doesn't feel the same
And a lot of girls say they're mine now
I would never trust them and right now
I would rather pass that blunt to you, like we used to do

Girl I am living life the wrong way
I am living it my own way
And you are everything I wanted
You knew I'd fuck you over someday, so you ran away
Cut me off cause you already knew wassup
And I deserved this shit I never tried to earn your trust
And I did not show you that I care but now I miss you

I think I need a hit of you
I'm faded when you're with me girl
I can't get enough, I'm stuck on you
'Cause your lovin' is worse than drugs
I turned into a fiend for you
I'm blazin' when you're with me girl
So I'd do anything you want me to
Listen up, girl I still fall for you
I need you back
I'll admit I never walk the talk but girl don't make me crawl for you
I'd give a hundred bitches cause they all the same
You're the one that's on my mind at night when I'm lonely
You know me well
I was doubting everything, you told me I'm the best
And I'll always trust you cause you're different from the rest

There's a lot of girls with me right now
Got a lot of drugs with me right now

And boy, it's hurtin' my head
It's the middle of October
And we just came to an end
I'm just sorry that there ain't no time left
You and I, we're over
Me and you are done
When I wanted to be closer
You just wanted to run
Though I know it's no one's fault
If I've learned anything at all
With us, no matter how I add it up, uh
One plus one is none
You've been on my mind for a while now
Tryna get you off 'cause this ain't right now
You said it was a vibe for the time being
It was nothing more, but I just couldn't see it
This is not a song for the whole world
Felt like it could've been us against the whole world
Baby, you were mine and I was your girl
Whatever happened to the time that we spent

I've been at this party for some time now
Sippin' on Bacardi 'til it runs out
You are in the corner with your head down
I don't even wanna know what that's about
'Cause you're the one that's always gettin' too wasted
And I'm the one that's never that intoxicated
Tonight I'm in my feelings, oh, I'm faded
But I don't wanna think about the complicated
Oh, your love got me feeling like I can't get up
Wishing for it but it never lasts
I thought we'd be together, oh, it ended so fast

Now that I am sober
