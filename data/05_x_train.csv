The horizon takes a trip along her body
Staring at the posters on your wall
As they talk about my chances
Boy, you're so tragic
Your floor was damaged from months ago
Where you dropped a hot comb dancing to nsoul
The trees are gold on your iPhone background
Which is funny 'cause you cut down
Like eight last spring for the view now
How's it look, baby?
How's it feel?
Is it too much for you?
Big fucking deal

Me me me
That's all we know
Me me me
That's all we know
You might think you do
But I bet you don't
You might think you do
But I bet you don't

I heard you joined the Peace Corps
Planting ferns and feeding the poor
You're not so bad anymore

I used to say ""When I get older I'll have all the hoes""
But my momma raised me right so I don't call them hoes
I mean I call em but it's just on some platonic shit
At least until the chronic lit, gin and tonic mix
You ain't the man unless you got a chick for every occasion
Milkshake from McDonald's thick, or skinny and basic
And subtractin' an ex never in the equation
No better than cavemen, had me trippin' tryna step with Temptations
But I could have two left feet and no rhythm
If she did give a sec to me, it's no kiddin'
Could tell it in her eyes, need umbrellas for her cries
She been tellin' little lies the size of Nicole Kidman
And I have to, do whatever for that wwwoo

Now a hourglass, her shape lookin' elastic
Not a hour passed without the shouts and harassment
Got a lotta followers hollerin' for a pic or
At least an at to acknowledge them
Uh, teach a college course on her collagen
Got endorsements and sponsors
And they promisin' a bag at the doorstep for the promo
It's like her big ol' Rihanna forehead is a logo
But so goes the saga
If she can make more than her momma
While walkin' in them clunky Balenciagas
Who am I to judge it?
These rappers trickin' 'til they out of budget
Just to get attention when they out in public
This what it come with, how you love it?
Or how you love anyone in particular when they comin' in hundreds?
We was raised to be the hunters
And providers for our mothers if our Fathers didn't love us
Our sisters who get the brunt of it
Run through bitches just for the fun of it
Uh, yeah, at what point you had enough of it?
Settle down, you know, the husband bit? Ah!
Yeah, this the culture I was accustomed with
We tried adjustin' but we couldn't get the cuffs to fit
And she be quick to fisticuffs when we discussin' it
Keep it a stack with you, brick by brick, we'll build the trust again"

Say you're dreaming and I’ve been, too
And one knows what you’ve been through
And I've been thinking a little deeper
Contemplation, getting cleaner
See no leaders, need more teachers
I'm in shambles, I don't sleep much

Guiding me so, so blind

Oh I lick the right spots, that's an ultimatum
The loud in rotation, cloud 9, flotation
Let the rose petals spread like rosacea

Could fill up an album with everything that they're missin'
They so superficial, don't understand how we're chillin'
We don't need a lot, we got us and that's why we're winnin'

You think the Earth is where you stand
You're in the palm of someone's hand

(Still up tryna escape the demons in my room, yo)
You see it's no change droppin' we learn to maintain profit
And how could anybody else feel pain when they brainwash us?
And watch us every time we make exchanges (We slaves)
Locked in a box, we use our mind just to escape all the same shit
I'm tired of the pain
Love is blind to the flame
That's why I look up, never hide behind sky's when it rain
Promises cooked up exercisin' through denyin' the pain
That's why I look for ways find whatever lies in the rain
'Cause shit change
I don't blame my father for lampin' I believe that helped
Went from tryna grow as your son to tryna grow as myself
So understand it when I'm stranded, takin' chances
Know I need that fall
Flat on my back, you just relax and kick your seat back, uh
'Cause when you think
That's when you let time run and escape what your mind loving
That's what you think
So what you think?
If love was easy to find, we wouldn't need it to complete our lives

Peace to the stars
Peace to Saturn
And peace to Mars"

I've been on the road, I've been grieving
I wonder if you're proud of the way to see me

Seen some shit and learned a couple lessons, but
I've been holdin' onto you

Remy got a girl that make him happy now
I'm seeing the world
Guess everything you want is working out
Sometimes you hit a low
Sometimes you feel alone
At times you need the heat to rise up on your own
Finally, I am reminded what got me here

Behind a blind of plastic plants

Then you know I can't remember a damn thing

Or a dream that's tryin' to tell me somethin'
Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it
I don't know, I doubt it
Subterranean by design
I wonder what I would find
If I met you, let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Mrs Princess Who?
I often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone; solitaire
I can remember when
I caught up with a patime intimate friend
She said, bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me
She was right, though, I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind
And I just put her right back with the rest

A neutron dance for a neutron fan
Marionette strings are dangerous things

An eye for an eye, a spy for spy
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning
Reality used to be a friend of mine
Cause complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on
But guess whose piece of the cake was jacked on?
She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do?
I feel for her, I really do
And I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest

Back when we would chill Blue dream going off

You covered all the bases like you knocked it out the park

You know I’m on the grind I got a shine and glow

I had you in your feels before I even copped a feel
You go straight to the room like ooh you know the drill and
Just like my crib you’re looking better in the hills
And we get to blowing on that chemical plotting
We the young and cynical
And we got the vape blowing up
Bigger than a blimp will do
That pussy make me feel invincible
I mean how could you go
I mean why would you though
You know that year you said I lost my marbles
Well I guess I turned them all to marble floors
I just thought that you oughta know
Crossed the country when we split
Aroud the same time I had a lil' bitch come through
And do a split up on the dick
So nasty I even made her spit
Ugh
But you the only one I could commit to

Now might not just be the time for us
But know that what we have will always last

As much as it hurts me in the feels, I hope he holds your hand
I pray to God that you live happily, appreciate yourself
Who knows maybe one day we'll be a family

But I will wait for you to say ""Come home""

Black tuxedo that I never got to wear
No invitation sent out anywhere
We don't have any guest to fill the chairs
I believe we could've been together in a past life
But right now we're committed to the fast life
All we're waiting for behind these chapel doors
Is a crashing course to a bad divorce

Walking down the aisle to the organ
Playing ""Here Comes The Bridе"" as a warning
The reality set in
Wе don't wanna do this anymore
Can't go through with this no more
Cold feet, someone, speak up
Or forever, hold your peace
Stand up, say it loud
Hear the whispers in the crowd
Somebody stop us now
Before we say our vows
Rice thrown in the air
Family cheer and praise (Praise)
Droptop drives away
""Just married"" on our plates
Before we get too far
And this ends the hard way (Way)
Just keep your white gown in the closet
And this black tuxedo that I never get to wear
No flower girl to walk with the ring bearer
No grooms and no raising glass in air

Well, now I know, we'll never know what happens
When our love just ain't the same no more
There's only divorce, we're waiting for our time
When emotions run their course

White gown in the closet (Closet)
And these rings that we'll never get to wear
Bridesmaids won't catch bouquets in the air
Train of garment won't be dragging down the stairs

You're supposed to love me to the tomb
Hardly stood a chance to tell the truth
Speak, baby, tell me that you knew
We came all this way to lose

But, what I did learn, is
Love will give you what you need
But also, take what you don't appreciate
This is crazy
This is crazy

It's happy tears, though

Or a dream that's trying to tell me something
Or will I ever stop thinking about it

I wonder what I would find if I met you
Let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Misses Princess who?
Often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone, solitaire
I can remember when I caught up
With a patime intimate friend, she said
""Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me.""
She was right, though, I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind

Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning
Reality used to be a friend of mine
Caused complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on
Guess whose piece of the cake is Jack gone
She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do

I wanted her to be a big P.M. Dawn fan

Give you the keys for that brand new tesla
Off of the one, unlock your thought 
They hate on me and jai forever
I let you in and showed you how I fell and you still didn't keep it a hunnid
I opened up, showed you my hurt, now I wish I didn't even bother
I was tryna find a way to get my team across

Blackberry to my head
Repeating all word you just said
You said it's getting real
And you don't know how I feel
You're falling in love
And now you're getting scared
(You wanna know)Do I feel the same
I'll be lying if I said yeah
Something we need to address
Before you hear me say yes
I've been down this road a time or two
So it's gotta be right for me and you
(So if I fall in love)
You gotta ride for me, like I'ma ride for you
(If I fall in love)
You gotta fight for me, the way I fight for you
(If I fall in love) Fall in love
You gotta hold it down, even when I'm not around
(If I fall in love, in love, in love, in love)

It's been 3 months, 4 days, 5 seconds till the minute
But who's counting?
And I ain't never ever, not once though about bouncing
They say you shouldn't ask questions
You don't wanna know the answer to
But I'm gon' answer you
See, I could be in love with you
But you would not believe it
And I could say I'm in love with you
And you'd say I make things easy
But, I've been down this road a time or two
That's why I only say
What I feel for you

(So if I fall in love)
You gotta ride for me, like I'ma ride for you
(If I fall in love)
You gotta fight for me, the way I fight for you
(If I fall in love) Fall in love
You gotta hold it down, even when I'm not around
(If I fall in love,in love, in love, in love)
Giiiirrrl, it's not that I don't want to be in love
But my love is stronger than you ever dreamed of
Have you ever had a hundred percent ?
A hundred percent of anything
When you look in my eyes and I don't reply
I don't want you to think that I
I don't love you, cause I doooooo
You're just not ready for me to show you, Girl

(So if I fall in love)
C'mon Baby
(If I fall in love)
I'll fight for you and you'll fight for me
(If I fall in love) If I were to fall in love
I'll hold it down with you and me girl
(If I fall in love, in love, in love, in love) Love

(So if I fall in love) If I fall in love
Baby tell me (If I fall in love)
Would you be there?
Would you be there baby? Hey
(If I fall in love) If I fall in love again
This time it's gonna be right

Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
You better not run 'cause the sirens not coming for you
What have you done?
You went to school that day
Was a bit late but it was a Monday
Kept after class for answering back
You apologized, ain't no harm in that?
(I wanna turn those blue lights)
What have you done?
(Into strobe lights)
There's no need to run
(Not blue flashing lights)
If you've done nothing wrong
(Maybe fairy lights)
Blue lights should just pass you by
Gun crime into your right ear
Drugs and violence into your left
Default white headphones flooding the auditory
Subconscious waves you accept
You're sitting on the 4 back home
""Where you at, G? Answer your phone!""
Paused the poison to answer his message
Your boy sounds rushed, fears for his adolescence

What have you done?
(Into strobe lights)
There's no need to run
(Not blue flashing lights)
If you've done nothing wrong
(Maybe fairy lights)
Blue lights should just pass you by
Tall black shadow as you're getting off the bus
Shadow shows no emotion so what's even the fuss?
But the face on your boy casts a darker picture
Of the red handed act, he's gonna whisper;
""Look blud, I'm sorry, 'cause I know you got my back
He was running, I couldn't think, I had to get out of that""
Not long ago you were miming to the ""Shook Ones""
Now this really is part two 'cause you're the shook one
Hands you the tool as you question your friendship
How's man like you gonna make me a convict?
Level of a felon when I've done nothing wrong
Blood on my hands but I don't know where it's from, oh
You got blood on your hands but you don't know where it's from

You better run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
'Cause they will be coming for you
Run when you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
The blue lights are coming for you

Are we broken? Lost in emotion
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?
Is this the last fight? Lay here one last night
I know we’re both tired, that's our excuse
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?
It's no one's fault, that's what they say
You want it your way, you know it all

You don't look at me the same
It's naive of me to think
That one day you'll miss my name

Promises you said you'd keep
Empty lines between the scenes
Was it wrong for me to trust?
I'm still only 17

Though I've been tryna get you off my mind

Pass you the ball and pass it back to me

When you rock my shirt
Oh, you look so good
So take my hand and stay as long as you can with the man

Fly in the song you sing
Why you waitin

Nice things from the shop
But I really think that Asia's bout to pop

Live each day like my last
Green like paper over plastic
Wrap my head around the whole world is a blast
If ya open up to magic
I just wanna tell you fly

You thought you had a fool, that's cool
You went behind my back, that's cool
But I can play this game like you
If he a dog, bitch, I'm a dog too
Ain't nobody got it like me
Did you forget that all these niggas like me?
And they'd be lucky to let me be wifey
So how could you be so damn triflin'?
When you hear about the dirt that I've done
You gon' be so fuckin' hurt cause I'm the one
You thought that you could just go out and have your fun
But I can play the same game except I won
Two wrongs don't make it right
But I'd be damned if I don't put up a fight
You say I'm wrong cause I cheated outta spite
I say you wrong cause you cheated every night

So, if he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
You tried to play me but the joke's on you
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
You tried to play me but the joke's on you

Two can play this game you call love
If you loved me then you wouldn't be a dog
If you loved me then you wouldn't creep at all
If this is love, then this ain't what I want
So you do you, and I'ma do me
No sense in playing with each others' feelings
But every time I try to go, you beg me not to leave
So what the hell am I supposed to think?
When you love someone, you pray that they will change
But you soon accept they'll always be the same
And they'll always try to treat you like a lame
So in return you treat them the same way
Two wrongs don't make it right
But I'd be damned if I don't put up a fight
You say I'm wrong cause I cheated outta spite
I say you wrong cause you cheated every night

So, if he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
You tried to play me but the joke's on you
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
If he a dog, I'm a dog too
You tried to play me but the joke's on you

If he a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
If he a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
If he a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
If he a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog

Done lost my job, wife walking out?

But I'm all they talk about
I've been doing wrong, I'm so sorry
Lord, please forgive me

THE BLOOD FROM YOUR SON WILL WASH ME FROM MY SINS
CLEAN THIS HOUSE, FROM THE INSIDE OUT
RESTORE ME, TAKE AWAY MY IMPURITY
LORD I NEED YOU TO
CLEAN THIS HOUSE FROM THE INSIDE OUT
RESTORE ME, TAKE AWAY MY IMPURITY
Wait a minute, I found a witness
Sitting here sippin' on something to drink
The enemy's got the best of me
And I gotta do something quick, before I go crazy
So many voices in my head, so load I can't even think
My friends and family are gone, my life is going so wrong
LORD, I need you to come, Oh! take me home, Oh! make
A way, Out of no way, MY HERO! come on and save the day!

I gotta keep it real...Lord my life needs a fix and I...
Said, I need you to do the remix, remix, (remix it for me)
Said I'm out here, and I know it ain't right, see inside I'm
Hurting, but a smile is on my face
Lord, take your holy broom, and sweep up the place!

Receive it, receive it, believe it, believe it, achieve it, achieve it"

How you say you love me when you hurt me at the same time

I know I've made mistakes but I'm real enough to own mine
Acting like you perfect but been fucking up this whole time
But I still care for you, thick and thin
You can't say I wasn't there for you, cause I was
Couldn't see the lies I was blinded by the love
Had to move on and let go of who I was
This is why I don't want to love no mo'
Cause I swear all girls are the same
This is why I don't want to trust no mo'
Cause I lеave more hurt than I came
This is why I don't comе around no mo'
Cause it hurts when I hear yo name
This is why I'm steady writing heartbreak songs
Cause I'm so poetic with my pain

Holdin' back tears but It's hard for me to manage it
Tired of being hurt I'm a product of my abandonment
How you do me wrong and try to say it was an accident
You did what you did at the expense of my happiness
Should've deemed my heart need a break
Feelings hard for me to shake
You don't know much it takes to keep a smile on my face
You used to beg for me to stay but now you dying for space
You just love you when you want like I'm easy to replace
Ooh I can't stand it
All thanks to you my soul's damaged
Pain turned me into a savage
Heart ain't been right since you had it
And the girl of my dreams been the reason that I stay up
Why you only recognize my worth after we break up
We in France alone I was the one you would rely on
Giving you cold shoulders same one you used to cry on
Said you'd never leave then you left like it was effortless
Even from the start I never thought that we were meant for this
I was scared of love cause I know it could be treacherous
Giving you my heart you left it open like my messages
Hurting in pain gotta let it go
Hurting inside but don't let it show
I ain't never felt this way before
So I'm singing this song just to let you know
This is why I don't want to love no mo'
Cause I swear all girls are the same (All girls)
This is why I don't want to trust no mo'
Cause I leave more hurt than I came
This is why I don't come around no mo'

Heard you got a new nigga
Laying in my bed but it feel a little bigger
I was so young when I fell in love with her
Trying to forget but I tend to reminisce when scrolling through old pictures (Woah)
Been living with pain day to day
Thinking 'bout the shit I should've said that I ain't get to say
Tryna move on for so long but I can't find a way
Wish memories would pull up like Kobe and just fade away
Mentally, don't know what you did to me
Nothing I could do that would erase all of this history
All this heart damage turned me into a savage
How our happiest memories also make me the saddest?
You thе only one I would run to
Needed an escapе you was the one who'd always come through
Though you not mine I always wonder what you up to
I can't explain why but I guess that's just what love do
And I really miss your energy
Don't know what you meant to me
Fuck Snapchat, always bringing up our memories
You the only one I can say really accepted me
Though I still remember every secret that you said to me
Wish that you was all mine
Honestly I'm not fine
Guess we fucked up and found love at the wrong time
But I'm still chasing after you
Tryna find a way back to you

If I knew that'd be the last time I'd ever get to hold you then I would've held you longer
Tend to blame myself know I should've held on
Wish I was a little bit stronger for you
Know it hurts there ain't no need to pretend
I can try to make it right
But I can't make you love me again

Everyday gets harder
You pushing me farther
Killing me inside but I'm acting like I'm unbothered
Turning me cold hearted
Since the day that we parted
Wishing that I could take it all back to where we had started
Back then, we was only friends
Started off so beautiful but look at where we end
Only opened up to you I wouldn't let nobody in
I don't think no one can ever make my heart do that again
But I still wish the best for you
Never gonna change that
Hoping there's a spark inside that's bound to bring our flame back
Smile on my face but my eyes holding rain back
I'll just take our memories and bury 'em where my pain at
Never been in love 'til now this is new to me
Do I miss us or am I missing who we used to be?
Really got me tripping can't explain what you do to me
When I said ""I love you"" understand I said that truthfully
So hold on tight for the ride it get bumpy
I know that it's selfish but I'm hoping you still love me
I just never thought we would be in this position
In fact it became so different influenced by bad decisions
I wish that you was all mine
Honestly I'm not fine
Guess we fucked up and found love at the wrong time
But I'm still chasing after you
Tryna find a way back to you

If I knew that'd be the last time I'd ever get to hold you then I would've held you longer

Hm, yeah, especially if you constantly gotta work
And do things that you might not wanna do (Mhm)
That's like temporary happiness real quick, it's an escape
And I make music about that because I feel it gets to a point
Where you live so much of your life in that state because you work so damn much (Ah)
It's been years and I been doin' the same shit
(Motherfuckers like to use that word, ""Toxic"")
(But that's the Internet word that people like to attach to shit)
I don't think that's an Internet word
I think that's a real word that really mеans something
Temporary euphoria (Mothеrfuckers like this the new shit though)
(Motherfuckers like, ""You never heard"")
Toxic's been around for, like, centuries
It's like I'm out this muhfucka for a lil' bit, while you bullshittin'
It's an escape, that's how I feel about it (Hm)
Shakespeare used it, that's a Twitter word
The Taming of the Shrew, anything that doesn't apply to you, feel me?
Yeah, it's like, you feel me (Rainbows and butterflies)
I fuck around, drink, and bullshit (They gon' be like, ""It was toxic"")
Bustin' random chicks and pop some E and bullshit
(But if you sing that, the people want you to make some shit that's romantic, or sweet)
It's like, ""Fuck it,"" like, it's an escape
(So if you sing some real shit, like what's toxic, what's real)
Honestly, truthfully, okay, I get that
I feel like I know I gotta wake up in the morning and go to work (I feel like there can be uh, maybe)
So lemme bullshit for the night (There's like a thin line)
(This right here euphoria, the thing that come with this shit) Or a release
(This, is, uh, it's like reality times ten)
(Every year before like ten years)
(As far as the people that you meet)
(The places that you go)
Temporary euphoria, or a release
(So it's because of that, naturally I'm gonna approach shit)
(A little more in retrospect, and it might come out harsh)
(But I think it's just more honest)
(Let's just keep that shit honest, fuck it)

You take me to places I've never known
And you push me to places I'll never go
I would die for you
Tell me the truth
Am I all that you would need?
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you

But you got me shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
I've been through it whole
I've been through the worst
But I never knew how much our love could hurt
Over my family I put you first
Writing out my feelings is the only thing that work
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too
But I hold on to the poems I would write you
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku
[Chorus 2
You got me shot down by love
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down, knocked down

But now I understand that you ain't never gonna change

I did everything you asked me to and baby now

I wish I knew you was a clown, I wouldn't've threw this ass back
Y'all said that I'm too good for you, shorty that's a fact
I gave you everything and more, and this is how you pay me back?
Now all I wanna know is was it the truth
You could've fucked them hoes lives up so why did you choose me?
Why did you use me? why did you bruise me?

Why you acting like you lost the crown
If you were never wearing one?
Falling ever deeper, dealing cards now
Now you can't recognize yourself on the deck
I thought I was your queen of hearts
But all the aces stole the check
A prince, a prince
A glorious game
A prince, a prince
Checkmate 'til you stole me away

Cursing words, am I a pauper now?
Even though all my shoes do fit
Won't even let me leave the house past 12
I ain't no fairytale chick
Happy endings cloud your head now
You have put your expectations too high
Sit on the bed, tears running down our eyes
Once upon a time, I wonder why

A prince, a prince
A glorious game
A prince, a prince
Checkmate 'til you stole me away

Darling hold on a second
You know that your eyes and your smile are a weapon
Now come here, why won't you just listen?
You tell me I'm hurting your arm with my grip
See now trust me, but never trust women
Yeah they're perfect, I'm at home stressed
With this skunk spliff
When I know that you're out on the road being faithless
Does it make sense?
And my insecurities don't pay rent
But they're living with me
And this is a disease
We live in a man's world so what you expect me to be?
Now, now, now
Whether it's the shit sex or this limp dick
My reflection keeps telling me sick things
You know that I'm ugly
I hope that you want me, I'll make sure you love me
A prince, a prince
A glorious game
A prince, a prince
Checkmate 'til you stole me away

No I've never been a prince, no, no
And I tried to be a king, oh Lord
Said I've never been a prince, no, no
And I tried to be a king, but I let you down, my queen
Oh you let me down, my king"

Telling me to wait and see
Fall to my knees
And let the rhythm come like it's naturally
But every time I wanna lead
I can't believe

And everywhere I go
I can't erase my home
Cause I know even if I don't call back
My loves keep me up when I fall back
Help me like I'm
Too tired to fill my role
Regenerate my wounds
And I owe them a piece of my whole
Cause I can't do it all on my own
You see my mama and my papa
Work too hard to see me suffer
In the presence of another
So I'll never let them down oh no I won't

She want me to buy her things her man can't afford like Tom Ford
Jeffrey Campbell boots and Helen Moore

Waitlist, single file, got a line, baby
You say my name like it’s mine, but you ain’t my lady

Go slow, cause you can’t take it all, too fat
When we done roll an L and I hit you with a stack

I get a little violent when I play the game of tag
I get a little quiet when I think about the bag
I slob when I sleep, and I wake up with a drag
I'm pulling out my teeth, so I wake up to the cash
This is who I am from the back to the front
I never had to pay for my schoolhouse lunch
My mama used stamps 'cause she need a little help
But a nigga made do with the cards been dealt
I try to act smart 'cause I want a lot of friends
I never really went with the flow of the trends
I think I like girls, but I think I like men

Had to wear my attitude to every dance recital
In my black Taylor Chucks, the ones that laced up
To my thighs, Lisa Frank lipstick on my eyes
Weird girl activity, Black bitch nativity
Spy girl erotica, bucket hat from Nautica
Clit throbbing, I start sobbing watching Narnia
I been winning trophies since Fear Factor
I was earning medals the same rate you basic bitches learned how to use protractors
Foot been on their necks before chiropractor
But I gave all the game boys cooties
Most of y'all are the type of kids I'd hate
If I was the monster under your beds, you'd be the kids I ate
If I was a man your mom fucked, I'd fuck her right in your face
And take you and your siblings on a Domino's pizza date
Damn, Gen X baby going crazy with the cam
Back when I was rhyming on my Green Eggs and Ham
Edited my pictures with the Microsoft filters
I was making Trillers way before they called 'em ""Trillers""
Sixth grade, every nigga pressured me to fuck
While y’all was givin' it up, I was servin' looks
Custmade drip with the pastry couture
Selling Silly Bandz from my desk to my drawer
Singing karaoke while my mom was at the store (""You are"")
Scared that she would walk in on me singing Paramore (""The only exception"")
While y'all was sticking house keys in motherfucking sockets (""You are"")
I was stuffing all y’all lunch moneys in my pocket
Please, stop it
I'm meant to blow up like the white things and soda rockets
Talking back to my teachers, I'm out of pocket
Got so much shit on my chest, yo, I need to drop it
Dribbling inside my journal, kiss my locket
Let the paper soak my tears up, Ultra Charmin
Ooh, I need to let it out (Let it out)
I gotta let it out (Let it out)

Undivided, undiscovered
Uninvited and I'm undercover

One love, you're heading on your own, love
Time out to be there, she said she won't care
Now you have something, before, you had nothing
I don't want to care, but your love's real
And it's an odd thing, how can I be your whole world?
We sit on the fake grass, and I won't believe that
And I never had enough for you, but you said someone
Would come and replace me, how can you replace me?

While it's true
It's all good now
When it's nothing, loving, nothing
That's all that you admire
And these tears
Fall in the sunlight

Way too much

When I speak it's like ya'll don't hear
Why I feel like God don't care
Why I feel like I ain't good as no one else
I'm searching but my pride ain't there
I just feel like life ain't fair
My boy got shot, died right there
But me, I died twice and came back to life
So tell me how can I be scared
Why do I gotta doubt myself
All I ever do is doubt myself
Drink liquor till the head gets consumed by the pint, like
I don't care about my health
Really I'm just trying to numb the pain
Love and hate it all just feels the same
Won't say I'm affected by the fame
But even my momma know I changed
So I get drunk till I can't feel
The love fake, the pains real
Got so many scars it ain't heal
But I gotta soul bullets can't kill
Why I feel like cops just want to pop me
Pop's never had a pot to piss in
Probably pack a nine on his hip then sit beside me
Pray to God there's no triple six inside me
No I can't let the devil in my mind
Same time the church will turn you blind
Last time I heard a preacher preach a sermon
All I heard him say was sinner's going to die
And they will never get to see a Heaven
With all due respect fuck the reverend
'Cause I know life is doing 25
Praying for early death like it's a blessing
This for my people going through depression
This for the kids who never felt affection
This for the kids whose parents don't accept them
Saying they love everyone else except them
I know what it's like to feel alone
I know what it's like to need a home
I know what it's like to not know what it's like
To have a love you can call your own
See I done tried every single fucking drug on that shelf
Trust me man it don't help
I just feel like I'm losing myself
I just feel like I'm losing myself
I just feel like I'm losing myself
I just feel like I'm losing myself
I just feel like I'm losing myself

Why I feel like love don't last
Things change when you move so fast
I was trying to focus on us in the future
You was focused on my past
If you left I would lose my soul
Promise me that you won't let go
See I just need love, it's funny I've got all this money
But my heart still broke
So many times I said I'ma change
Just to turn around and do the same
Same shit that's been putting you in pain
I know I'm the only one to blame
So I get drunk, till I can't see
I love you, but I hate me
For tryna be someone I can't be
And I ain't been myself lately
Why I feel like I'm the only one that got me
You could take the same 45 that shot me
Pop the clip in, cock it back and put that motherfucker to my head, you'll never stop me
Yeah I be living life on the edge
Suicide all in my head
Why the world don't care about no one else's life till they already dead
I just wish my pops was back to how he was
'Cause he ain't been the same since the drugs
And I ain't been the same since he said
The worst form of pain is not being loved
So we use the drugs that they gave to us
To replace the love the world takes from us
Lately I don't even know who to trust
They saying even Satan was an angel once
So I can't feel shit, so numb that I can't feel shit
Living just to die, we dying just to live
This life it doesn't make no sense
See I done tried every single fucking drug on that shelf
Trust me man it don't help
I just feel like I'm losing myself
I just feel like I'm losing myself
I just feel like I'm losing myself
I just feel like I'm losing myself
I just feel like i'm losing myself"

Don't act like I ain't pay my dues
I'm picking up the pace, It's all about the chase
You could try to fake the moves
But that'll be a way to lose, yeah
Just another phase, the summer 'fore you place, yeah
Man, for real, that's just how I feel
Everything is honest, when a nigga know what's real
See, I can make a song about the shit that really kills
But you would shut it down because you hating on my skills
I put you in a headlock, for like 3 shots
4 more, 5, 6, 7
Heavily armed military goons, it's nonstop for you niggas
Please carry on
It's fuck
Fuck y'all
Yeah

Yeah, fuck y'all
Yeah
Fuck y'all, fuck y'all

Nigga all I hear is (Rrrrah)
Can't reply, way to high for all that (Yda)
Yea I know, niggas used to be, gagagagang
But in life, there are things that we just can't maintain
Gangland is the main frame
Heartbeat of the city, is where we were born
I didn't know shit about shit back when you put me on
You told me what was legit, and what was ludicrous
Never let the homegirl know I was new to this
(Stupid lil niggas)
See I was a November baby, so I was the kid brother
We was in the same grade
Whatever we did, yo, we did together
Damn near live together, and when we got older I thought we were gonna win together
But I played you my first song and you hated it
Sent you another 5 and you never replied
Now you tryna hit me on that (Rrrrah)
When you know I ain't really on that (Yda)
Fast forward 5 years later, I'm getting paper
Might see me in the sky, in my scraper
But it's

Fuck y'all
Yeah
(Fuck this)
Yeah, fuck y'all
Yeah
Fuck y'all, fuck y'all

For real, mayne
I just wanna sign my deal, mayne

Keep it trill, mayne
Know the deal, mayne"

Even though we don't talk like we used to
I still watch your page, just so I can check on you
And I know that you don't love me like you used to
But I ain't never loved before and I think I love you
And I know that you got scars
Tryna find the pieces to your heart
And I know I let you down before
But that was before we just fell apart
Even though we don't talk like we used to
When I hear this song, I still start to think of you
All the shit we did, all the shit we been through
Sorry for putting these bitches I had before you
I can tell you scared to love me
But I wish that you could trust me
And I know right know it's, ""Fuck me""
All the lying made you not want me
And I hate I hurt you before, but you hurt me more
You told me that you was gone
I poured my heart out and you turned it so cold
All that love, crazy that it's all gone
I had your heart, now it's broke, but I can admit my wrong
I was fuckin' with these bitches
But we had some good times, I know you miss it
Know I'm the reason you're hurting, but I can fix it
So can you stop all that crying and sit and listen?

And I don't know how to love, but I'm trying to
And I know we won't work, but it's worth trying to
I just keep doing you wrong, steady lying to you
She say she wanna feel alive, that she been dying to

Even though we don't talk like we used to
I still watch your page, just so I can check on you
And I know that you don't love me like you used to
But I ain't never loved before and I think I love you
And I know that you got scars
Tryna find the pieces to your heart
And I know I let you down before
But that was before we just fell apart
Even though we don't talk like we used to
When I hear this song, I still start to think of you

I've been passing time watching trains go by
All of my life
Lying on the sand watching sea birds fly
Wishing there would be someone waiting home for me
Something's telling me it might be you
Yes, it's telling me it might be you
All of my life

Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life
Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place, would I recognize the face?
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah, it's telling me it might be you
So many quiet roads to take
So many dreams to make
And with so much love to make
I think we're gonna need some time
Maybe all we need is time
And it's telling me it might be you
All of my life

I've been saving love songs and lullabies
And there's so much more
No one's ever heard before
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah, it's telling me it must be you
And I'm feeling it'll just be you all of my life

Yeah, maybe it's you, maybe it's you
I've been waiting for all of my life
Maybe it's you, maybe it's you
I've been waiting for you all of my life, yeah
Maybe it's you, maybe it's you
I've been waiting for all of my life"
